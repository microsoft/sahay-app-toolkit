## URL Mapping Component.

When using html text as content, there might a small portion within the text that directs to a different section/component within the app.

Example.

There are 2 components : COMPONENT_KEY1 and COMPONENT_KEY2

Let in COMPONENT_KEY1 there be content text as follows:

contentText : `<p>Hi, this is COMPONENT_KEY1. If you want to visit COMPONENT_KEY2 visit <a href="NavigationScenes.COMPONENT_KEY2">here</a></p>`
